Tasks
=====

A simple iOS Tasks app, with a Google Tasks sync feature.

It's an Universal App.

Works fine on my iPhone 4S and all other simulators (except 64bits one).

Requirements
=====
- Project was created on Xcode 6 beta 4, but compile without problems on Xcode 5.
- Project can't compile targeting 64 bits devices simulators (a.k.a iPhone/iPad Retina 64bit, iPad Air) : Google Toolbox can't compile for 64bit iOS.

Why ?
=====
This is a test for a company

Notes ?
=====
Sure, in the [NOTES.md](NOTES.md) file
