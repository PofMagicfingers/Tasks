Tasks
=====

A simple iOS Tasks app, with a Google Tasks sync feature. 

It's an Universal App, but it can't be build for the iPad Air simulator, for an unknown reason. I don't have any iPad Air to try it. 

Works fine on my iPhone 4S and all other simulators though.

Why ?
=====
This is a test for a company

Notes ?
=====
Sure, in the [NOTES.md](NOTES.md) file
